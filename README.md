Gas
===

Gas is a 2D shader-based game rendering engine written in C# and using the Managed DirectX bindings (not XNA).

Gas features a modular material and visual effect system. Materials, specified using an XML format, can be assigned visual effects, which are implemented using a common infrastructure and shaders in DLL modules. Several sample effects are provided, including texture mapping, normal mapping, per-pixel lighting, and a water distortion effect.
